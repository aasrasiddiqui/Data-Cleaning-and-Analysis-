Data CLeaning and Analysis – Salary Dataset

📌 Overview
This assignment focuses on data analysis, cleaning, and preprocessing using Python. The goal is to explore a real-world dataset, handle common data quality issues, and prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
The dataset used is a Salary Dataset sourced from Kaggle.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas – for data exploration and manipulation
EDA / Visualization tools (Matplotlib / Seaborn)
Scikit-learn – for scaling and encoding

📂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Type: Salary-related dataset
Purpose: To practice data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

🔍 Steps Performed

1️⃣ Data Exploration
Loaded the dataset using Pandas
Inspected shape, data types, and basic statistics
Identified missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries

2️⃣ Data Cleaning
The following data quality issues were handled:
Missing values:
Identified and treated using appropriate strategies (e.g., removal or imputation)
Duplicate records:
Detected and removed to ensure data integrity
Incorrect / inconsistent values:
Cleaned to maintain accuracy and consistency

3️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Feature Scaling:
Applied scaling techniques to normalize numerical features
Feature Engineering:
Created or transformed features to improve data usability
Categorical Encoding:
Converted categorical variables into numerical format suitable for analysis

4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized key patterns and relationships in the data
Used graphs and plots to:
Understand data distribution
Identify trends and outliers
Gain insights into salary-related factors

📊 Key Learnings
Practical experience in real-world data cleaning challenges
Improved understanding of data preprocessing techniques
Hands-on exposure to exploratory data analysis and visualization
Learned how proper data preparation impacts downstream analysis and modeling

🚀 Conclusion
This assignment strengthened my understanding of data analysis pipelines, from raw data exploration to cleaned, well-structured datasets ready for machine learning or further statistical analysis.
